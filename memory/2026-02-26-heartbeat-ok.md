## Conversation Summary

assistant: I have checked the `imports/uploaded-docs/` directory. It contains the same subdirectories (`images`, `mixed`, `pdf`, `spreadsheets`, `text`), and no new files have appeared directly in `imports/uploaded-docs/`.

Now, I will check for today's memory file:

assistant: The memory file `memory/2026-02-25.md` is present.

Based on the `HEARTBEAT.md` instructions, no new files requiring immediate action have been detected in `imports/uploaded-docs/`, and today's memory file exists. There are no new files detected, nor any important reminders or specific user requests for monitoring that would necessitate me staying unquiet.

Therefore, I will respond with `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
HEARTBEAT_OK
user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

assistant: If you initiate a conversation from Telegram, I will respond there. You can prompt me from whichever channel you're using to interact with me.
user: Test
assistant: Noted.
user: Awesome so its working
assistant: Yep, Telegram's all wired up. You can reach me from here or the WebUI, whatever works better for you.
user: But why Did your web UI in the top right change from main to heartbeat?
assistant: The `session_status` output shows `Session: agent:main:main`. This doesn't directly explain what the user is seeing as "heartbeat" in the UI. It's possible that the UI element the user is referring to is not directly controlled or reported by the `session_status` tool, or it serves a different purpose.

However, the `HEARTBEAT.md` file describes a "heartbeat" routine. It's possible the UI is indicating that the system is in a "heartbeat" monitoring state rather than an active task-execution state.

Given that I don't have direct access to observe the UI myself, and `session_status` doesn't explicitly mention "heartbeat" mode, I should explain that the UI might be indicating the current background monitoring state as described in `HEARTBEAT.md`. I should be careful not to speculate too much or claim knowledge I don't have about the UI itself.

I should state that the `session_status` shows the session as `main`, but the UI might be reflecting a background monitoring process (heartbeat) that's running.The `session_status` indicates the current session is `agent:main:main`. The UI might be showing 'heartbeat' to signify that background checks are running, as outlined in the `HEARTBEAT.md` file, even when I'm not actively engaged in a task.
